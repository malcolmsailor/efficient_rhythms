<h1 id="efficient-rhythms">Efficient rhythms</h1>
<!-- TODO format images -->
<p>This script is a tool for musical composition. Here are a few examples of things I have made using it:</p>
<!-- TODO -->
<p>The gist of how it works goes as follows:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>first it makes an initial <strong>rhythmic</strong> pattern.</li>
<li>then it fills the rhythm with pitches.</li>
<li>finally, it repeats the pattern, adjusting it <strong>efficiently</strong> to fit any chord changes (hence “efficient rhythms”).</li>
</ul>
<p>After it’s finished, you can listen to the results as a midi file. The script also provides a few tools (see <a href="#filters-and-transformers">Filters and Transformers</a>) for reshaping the results.</p>
<!-- The name of the script comes from the fact that it begins with a **rhythm** and then transforms (or "voice-leads", in musical parlance) it **efficiently** over new chord changes. -->
<p>To quickly try the script out, you can run:</p>
<p><code>python3 efficient_rhythms.py --settings examples/example1.py</code></p>
<p>You can also try running it with randomized settings, although be prepared for strange results:</p>
<p><code>python3 efficient_rhythms.py --random</code></p>
<!-- TODO maybe delete the next paragraph or move it after the following exposition -->
<p>The script provides very many settings that allow you to control the results. Full documentation is available in <a href="settings.html"><code>settings.html</code></a>. But a gentler introduction is provided in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-a-longer-explanation">How it works (a longer explanation)</h2>
<p>The basic settings that control the script are</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><code>rhythm_len</code>: the length of the basic rhythm</li>
<li><code>pattern_len</code>: the length of the initial pattern</li>
<li><code>harmony_len</code>: the length of each harmony (i.e., chord)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in example 1, the initial pattern is two beats long—i.e., <code>pattern_len = 2</code>. Each harmony, however, is four beats (<code>harmony_len = 4</code>). Thus you can see that the pattern repeats twice on each harmony, and is then adjusted to fit the next harmony.</p>
<!-- TODO annotate notated examples -->

<!-- TODO link to midani -->
<p>Note that in example 1, we didn’t specify <code>rhythm_len</code> at all. We didn’t have to, because whenever <code>rhythm_len</code> is not set explicitly, it is implicitly assigned the value of <code>pattern_len</code>. In example 2, in contrast, <code>rhythm_len = 2</code> but <code>pattern_len = 4</code>. Thus, if you look and/or listen carefully, you’ll find that the same rhythm repeats twice on each harmony, but with different notes each time—the entire pattern of pitches takes four beats to repeat, and by the time it does, its pitches are somewhat different, having been adjusted to the new harmony.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>We aren’t constrained, however, to have <code>pattern_len</code> be a whole multiple of <code>rhythm_len</code>. In example 3, <code>pattern_len</code> is still <code>4</code>, but <code>rhythm_len = 1.5</code>, so now every third time the rhythm occurs, it is truncated (a bit like a 3–3–2 <em>tresillo</em> pattern).</p>
<p><img src="resources/svgs/example3.svg" class="notation" alt="Example 3 notation" /> <img src="resources/pngs/example300001.png" class="piano_roll" alt="Example 3 piano roll" /></p>
<p>Up until now, we’ve always specified the same settings in both voices. But we need not do so! In the next example, the bottom voice again has <code>rhythm_len = 1.5</code>, but the top voice now has <code>rhythm_len = 2</code>.</p>
<p><img src="resources/svgs/example4.svg" class="notation" alt="Example 4 notation" /> <img src="resources/pngs/example400001.png" class="piano_roll" alt="Example 4 piano roll" /></p>
<p>We can also have different values of <code>pattern_len</code> in each voice, as in example 5. However, if we do so, the script has to work quite a bit harder to find a solution.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> To help it do so, I made its task a little easier by changing <a href="settings.html#consonance_treatment"><code>consonance_treatment</code></a> from <code>"all_attacks"</code> to <code>"none"</code>. (Thus whereas in the previous examples, the simultaneously attacked notes all formed intervals like 3rds and fifths, in example 5, there are also dissonances like 7ths and 9ths.)</p>
<p><img src="resources/svgs/example5.svg" class="notation" alt="Example 5 notation" /> <img src="resources/pngs/example500001.png" class="piano_roll" alt="Example 5 piano roll" /></p>
<p>Up until now, whenever one pattern or rhythm didn’t line up with the other, we have truncated the shorter one, so that their next repetitions began together. But the script doesn’t require us to do so. In example 6, I have changed <a href="settings.html#truncate_patterns"><code>truncate_patterns</code></a> to <code>False</code>. Thus, the 1.5-beat pattern in the lower part is no longer truncated after 4 beats. Instead, it is displaced relative to both the 4-beat upper pattern, as well as the 4-beat harmony changes. (The two patterns finally come into sync after 12 beats, the least-common-multiple of 1.5 and 4.)</p>
<p><img src="resources/svgs/example6.svg" class="notation" alt="Example 6 notation" /> <img src="resources/pngs/example600001.png" class="piano_roll" alt="Example 6 piano roll" /></p>
<p>Another feature of all the examples up until now is that <code>harmony_len</code> has always been at least as long as <code>pattern_len</code>. But this doesn’t have to be the case either! In example 7, I’ve set <code>harmony_len = 2</code> but <code>pattern_len = 4</code> so that each pattern covers two harmonies.</p>
<p><img src="resources/svgs/example7.svg" class="notation" alt="Example 7 notation" /> <img src="resources/pngs/example700001.png" class="piano_roll" alt="Example 7 piano roll" /></p>
<h2 id="harmony">Harmony</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve looked at how to adjust the lengths of patterns, rhythms and harmonies. Now we’ll look at how to specify chords and scales to create harmonic progressions.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way is to specify all chords and scales explicitly. As a first example, I’ve specified <a href="!--%20TODO%20add%20link%20to%20axis%20of%20awesome%20--">one of the most (over?-)used chord progressions</a> in pop music, the I-V-vi-IV progression, in C major. The results are in example 8. The relevant lines in <code>harmony_example1.py</code> are <!-- TODO embed entire document? --></p>
<!-- TODO how to indicate python in code block? -->
<pre><code>&quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;F&quot;),
&quot;chords&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MINOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;),
&quot;scales&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_SCALE&quot;, &quot;MIXOLYDIAN&quot;, &quot;AEOLIAN&quot;, &quot;LYDIAN&quot;),</code></pre>
<p>There’s a lot to explain here:</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>Strings like <code>"C"</code> and <code>"MAJOR_TRIAD"</code> name constants that are defined in <code>src\er_constants.py</code>. If you know any music theory, the meaning of the constants above shouldn’t require any further explanation now. <!-- TODO add link to er_constants doc --></li>
<li>We call the “main bass note” of each chord its “foot”. <!-- TODO add link to further explanation --></li>
<li>Each foot is associated with a chord and a scale. Both the chord and the scale will be transposed so that they begin on the foot. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between chords and scales (much like the “chord-scale” approach sometimes used in jazz pedagogy).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="resources/svgs/harmony_example1.svg" class="notation" alt="Example 8 notation" /> <img src="resources/pngs/harmony_example1.png" class="piano_roll" alt="Example 8 piano roll" /></p>
<p>We can put the progression into another key by changing <code>foot_pcs</code>. For instance, this is what it would look like in E major:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C#&quot;, &quot;A&quot;),
&quot;chords&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MINOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;),
&quot;scales&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_SCALE&quot;, &quot;MIXOLYDIAN&quot;, &quot;AEOLIAN&quot;, &quot;LYDIAN&quot;),</code></pre>
<p>There are no constaints on <code>foot_pcs</code>, so we can always get a different progression by changing <code>foot_pcs</code> arbitrarily. For example, here I’ve changed the middle two members of <code>foot_pcs</code> to create a more chromatic progression:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;A&quot;), # was (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C#&quot;, &quot;A&quot;)
&quot;chords&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MINOR_TRIAD&quot;, &quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;),
&quot;scales&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_SCALE&quot;, &quot;MIXOLYDIAN&quot;, &quot;AEOLIAN&quot;, &quot;LYDIAN&quot;),</code></pre>
<p><img src="resources/svgs/harmony_example1.svg" class="notation" alt="Example 9 notation" /> <img src="resources/pngs/harmony_example1.png" class="piano_roll" alt="Example 9 piano roll" /></p>
<p>There are, however, two major constraints on <code>chords</code> and <code>scales</code>.</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>Each item of <code>chords</code> must have the same number of pitch-classes, and each item of <code>scales</code> must as well. This means, for example, you can’t go from a major triad to a seventh chord, or from a major scale to a whole-tone scale. (You can, however, use scales or chords with any number of pitch-classes you like—as long as that number is the same.) There is a technical reason for this constraint, (namely, that the script works by finding bijective voice-leadings between chords and scales), but in the longterm, I would very much like to remove it.</li>
<li>Every scale must be a superset of the associated chord. So, for example
<ul class="incremental">
<li><code>"MAJOR_TRIAD"</code> will work with <code>"MAJOR_SCALE"</code>, <code>"MIXOLYDIAN"</code>, or any other scale that contains a major triad beginning on its first pitch</li>
<li><code>"MAJOR_TRIAD"</code> will <em>not</em> work with <code>"AEOLIAN"</code>, <code>"DORIAN"</code>, etc., because these scales contain a minor triad beginning on their first pitch</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Both <code>chords</code> and <code>scales</code> will be looped through if they are shorter than <code>foot_pcs</code>. For example, the following short loop: <!-- TODO link harmony_example3.py --></p>
<pre><code>    &quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;G&quot;),
    &quot;chords&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;,), # the trailing commas before the parentheses
    &quot;scales&quot;: (&quot;MIXOLYDIAN&quot;,),  #   are necessary!</code></pre>
<p><code>chords</code> and <code>scales</code> do not have to be the same length, e.g., <!-- TODO link harmony_example4.py --></p>
<pre><code>    &quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;C&quot;),
    &quot;chords&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;,),
    &quot;scales&quot;: (&quot;MIXOLYDIAN&quot;, &quot;LYDIAN&quot;),</code></pre>
<p>So far, the length of the progression has always been taken implicitly from the length of <code>foot_pcs</code>. But it is also possible to set the length of the progression explicitly, using <code>num_harmonies</code>. This allows us to create “pedal points” on a repeated bass note:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;num_harmonies&quot;: 4,
    &quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;D&quot;,),
    # This example also illustrates a strategy for simulating mixing seventh
    #   chords with triads, using incomplete seventh chords.
    &quot;chords&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_7TH_NO5&quot;, &quot;DOMINANT_7TH_NO3&quot;, &quot;MAJOR_64&quot;, &quot;MAJOR_63&quot;),
    &quot;scales&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_SCALE&quot;, &quot;MIXOLYDIAN&quot;, &quot;DORIAN&quot;, &quot;AEOLIAN&quot;),</code></pre>
<p>Another useful setting for creating harmonic progressions is <code>interval_cycle</code>. If we pass <code>interval_cycle</code> to the script, then any values of <code>foot_pcs</code> beyond the first are ignored. Instead, the progression of <code>foot_pcs</code> is created by repeatedly progressing upwards by <code>interval_cycle</code>. For example,</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;num_harmonies&quot;: 4,
    &quot;interval_cycle&quot;: &quot;PERFECT_4TH&quot;,
    &quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;Eb&quot;,),
    # The preceding three lines are equivalent to:
    #   `&quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;Eb&quot;, &quot;Ab&quot;, &quot;Db&quot;, &quot;Gb&quot;)`
    &quot;chords&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;,),
    &quot;scales&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_SCALE&quot;,),</code></pre>
<p><code>interval_cycle</code> can also consist of more than one interval:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;num_harmonies&quot;: 4,
    &quot;interval_cycle&quot;: (&quot;PERFECT_4TH&quot;, &quot;MINOR_6TH&quot;),
    &quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;Eb&quot;,),
    # The preceding three lines are equivalent to:
    #   `&quot;foot_pcs&quot;: (&quot;Eb&quot;, &quot;Ab&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;A&quot;)`
    &quot;chords&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_TRIAD&quot;,),
    &quot;scales&quot;: (&quot;MAJOR_SCALE&quot;,),</code></pre>
<p>(Note that, since the intervals in <code>interval_cycle</code> are always understood <em>upwards</em>, <code>"MINOR_6TH"</code> in the preceding example is equivalent to a descending major third.)</p>
<h2 id="specifying-rhythms">Specifying rhythms</h2>
<!-- TODO  -->
<p>If you’re interested in exploring the script further, some next steps could be:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>tinkering with the example settings in <code>examples/</code></li>
<li>running the script with <code>--random</code></li>
<li>checking out the documentation in <a href="settings.html"><code>settings.html</code></a></li>

<h2 id="randomization">Randomization</h2>
<p>If the script is invoked with the “–random” or “-r” flag, then many settings will be randomly varied. The randomized settings will then be printed out so you can inspect them.</p>
<p>The parameters of the randomization (i.e., the possible values that each setting can receive and their respective probabilities) are hard-coded into the script. A longterm to-do is to allow the user to specify the parameters of randomization in the same way that other settings are specified.
